Hobby project implementing my own ray-tracer

I got really excited about redoing one of the projects I did at University
(https://github.com/rcedermalm/Monte-Carlo-ray-tracer), but this time doing
it on my own and without the stress of getting it to work before a deadline.
This will hopefully give me the chance of going further than I did before
and learn a lot of new stuff!

Project started November 6, 2019.
